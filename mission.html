    <h1>For an Advanced Future</h1>
    <p>Machine Learning is an emerging field of Computer Science that allows software to act without being explicitly programmed. This technology holds the key to building new computer apps that can and will improve people's lives. Examples of this technology include real-time online threat detection, cancer diagnosis, and piloting autonomous vehicles. The next stage of human development surely calls for widespread research of Machine Learning.</p>
    <h1>Complex Problems and Opportunities</h1>
    <p>The twenty-first century has seen the highest level of technological automation in world history. With this development, new problems and opportunities have arisen. For the first time, humans are using personal assistants, speech-to-text translators, and intelligent search engines every day. Researchers and enterpreneurs are given the responsibility to identify these areas, and continue to push the edge of the technology industry forward.</p>

Artificial Neural Networks are a simple model for machine learning. These networks attempt to model electrical impulses in the human brain sent by neuron cells. In an Artificial Neural Network, artificial neurons are organizaed into separate layers connected by strength parameters called weights.
Tuning these weights changes how the algorithm will responsd when exposed to a certain input pattern. By tuning these weights using stochastic gradient descent, Articial Neural Networks are able adapt and learn.
